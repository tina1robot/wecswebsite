              The paint night also served as a platform for networking, allowing students to connect with peers and seniors in a non-traditional setting.
              It highlighted the importance of community and support among women pursuing careers in STEM, showcasing that creativity and innovation go hand in hand.
              <br /> <br />
              By the end of the night, each participant left with a unique tote bag, a symbol of their creativity and a reminder of the empowering community they are a part of.
              This event was a testament to the club's commitment to fostering a supportive and inclusive environment for women in engineering and computer science.
              <br /> <br />
